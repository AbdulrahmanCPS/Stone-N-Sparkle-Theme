Stone Sparkle – WordPress Theme Starter

What this gives you
- A clean starter theme with your brand palette + provided fonts bundled locally.
- WooCommerce support enabled.
- A custom homepage template file: page-home-page.php (WordPress automatically uses it for a page with slug: home-page).
- Auto-redirect: if your site front page isn't set, visiting / will redirect to /home-page/ (if that page exists).

Install (GoDaddy / WordPress)
1) Zip the theme folder and upload it:
   WP Admin → Appearance → Themes → Add New → Upload Theme → choose the ZIP → Install → Activate.

2) Create the homepage page using the correct slug:
   Pages → Add New → title it “Home Page” (or any title)
   On the right sidebar, set the “Slug” to: home-page
   Publish.

3) Make it the site’s homepage (recommended, cleaner than redirects):
   Settings → Reading → Your homepage displays → A static page
   Homepage: select your “Home Page” page.

Homepage layout (matches your reference)
- If the page is empty, the theme renders a starter “lookbook” layout automatically.
- Better: use the block pattern:
  Edit the Home Page → Add block → Patterns → Stone Sparkle → “Homepage Lookbook (Starter)”
  Then replace the placeholder cover blocks with your real images, and update links.
